# opampDL_phaseMargin
on this project I took a two stage opamp. Sweeping the M of the diff pair, active load, Mos output stage, C miller and R I tried to predict the phase margin
( very few data should add more!!!)


(some parameters to sweep the l, more steps on C miller, R, and of course try with other Ibias
